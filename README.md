My personal doffiles for linux and macos

## Pre-requisite

zsh needs to be installed and set as default shell due to the `ohmyzsh`

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarrenVictoriano/dotfiles/main/_bin/install-zsh.sh | bash
```

## Installation

To install this run this script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarrenVictoriano/dotfiles/main/install.sh | bash

### bat Theme setup

Rebuild the themes for bat when running for the first time.

```bash
